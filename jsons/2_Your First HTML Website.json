  "text": " In the last video, you guys gave me a lot of love. It's my pleasure to keep this course free. There is a like for this free course. You know, when I started web development, there was no comprehensive course of this quality. Forget about being paid for free, there was no such course. So I can understand that being free of this course is very important for some people. And trust me, I live up to the expectations. With that said, like this video because we are going to make our first website in this video. And in this video, I am going to order the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Why? How? What will happen? We'll see in the next video. For some of you, this will be the first website of your life. So it's going to be fun. You guys are excited, right? Write in the comments, I am excited. And whatever you write in the comments, I will heart those comments. In this video, we will learn to link an HTML website with CSS and JavaScript. Along with that, in this video, I am going to give you notes, cheat sheets, and many other resources. I will tell you some such techniques which I have learned in years. And we will make your web development speed 10x. In this video, we will also see how to make our VS Code awesome. That your VS Code screen will look like a killer. In this video, I will also tell you how to earn money from web development. So let's start with full energy. Let's roll the intro. Music Alright guys, so we have come to our computer screen. Before moving forward in the video, I would like to tell you all to access this playlist. Secondly, we are very close to 5 million subscribers. So if you haven't hit the subscribe button, then do it. In today's video, we are going to make our first website, as I have already told you. So the first thing we will do is to customize our VS Code. So this is the folder in which we started our web development series. Now I want to give you the source code of this web development series. So I will configure the Git here. Now it is not necessary to know the Git for you guys. But I will fire the GitHub desktop here. And what I will do here is I will add a new repository. I will click on add here. I will click on create new repository. I will name it as sigma. Web dev course. And this is our folder. So I will select this folder. I will initialize this repository with grid. And I will write the source code for sigma web development course here. I will click on create repository. By doing this, we will create a repository which is called sigma web dev course. I will add all the things that were relevant to the first video. So these were the files that were relevant to the first video. So I will name it video1. Right click, new folder. I will make a video1 here. And I will move these files to video1 folder. I am not pushing all the videos on Git. These are sample videos. You can use your sample videos. So now I will keep updating the source code here. And I will keep pushing it on Git. Now how do we push it on Git? You don't need to learn this. But this procedure is very simple. Why do we use Git? I would like to tell you that Git is used by web developers. And then by general coders. When they have to collaborate their code with other people. So what will happen is that you will work with many programmers. And those programmers will collaborate with your source code. And to do this kind of collaboration, they will push some code. You will also push some code. Maybe one person is editing one file. Another person is editing another file. So here GitHub is used. And what is GitHub desktop? GitHub desktop is a utility to use Git. The difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is open source. But GitHub is Microsoft's own company. So using Git, repositories help you to host on your web interface. I will tell you more about Git in the upcoming videos. But I am pushing this repository on my Code with Harry GitHub account. So you will get the link of repository in the description. So as soon as I give you the links, you will get all the code. And I will talk about this later. I am making this video as a course impact. So that absolute beginners can follow this. So when I click on the published repository, I will get the link of the code. This folder will sync with my GitHub account. So all the code that I am going to upload here will go to my GitHub account. And it will keep on syncing. All the changes will be there. If someone has made any changes there, I can pull them here. I can click on it and then fetch origin. I will teach you all this. I will dedicate the whole video to Git. Don't worry. I did this so that I can give you the code. Now I will make a folder called video2. And I will go inside this folder. I will press shift and right click. And I will open with VS Code. So here is open with code. You will get this option. If you have, as I said, installed VS Code. If you have made any changes and you haven't checked, which is the check box, which I have shown you, then you might have a problem. So we will no this. We will dismiss the notification. Now whatever file I will make here, like I will make index.html here, that file will be made here too. So everyone knows about this. I know that many intermediate people are saying that we already know all these things. But I am making this course so that all beginners can follow along. So I will make 3 files here. One I made index.html here. The second file I will make is style.css. And the third file I will make is script.js. And the name of these files can be anything. But I just want to keep these files self-explanatory. That by looking at their names, you will know what they are doing. index.html, html file, script.js, javascript file, style.css, a style sheet. So I made these 3 files here. I will go to index.html and put an exclamation mark. And as soon as I put an exclamation mark, you can see that this code has come here. I will click on view word wrap so that you can see this code. The horizontal scroll bar from word wrap moves away. I checked the word wrap here. So here you can see that we will understand this code. But for now, you can understand that this code, html code, we use it to make a website. Now come to the extensions tab of VS Code. To enhance the functionality of extensions VS Code, we use VS Code. We use extensions to make VS Code better. VS Code extensions help us write code. So which extension will we use? First of all, I will put some extensions which will make our VS Code clear. If your friends see this, they will say that this is a hacker. So what I will do now is VS Code Icons. There is an extension called VS Code Icons. I will install it. You will get to know that the file you are seeing here has an icon. This icon was not there before. You can see it in the video. You can see all the icons here. Thanks for installing VS Code Icons. I will activate it. And you can see that our icons are looking good. In the coming time, if we make a folder, this icon will come. So these icons look good. We will come back to the extensions tab. There are many themes that you can use. Some themes are Jellyfish themes. There is one, GitHub themes. There are many themes. You can use these themes. But I can only use one theme at a time. This is the theme of default VS Code which shows you VS Code in this way. If I change my theme, then my VS Code will look different. I will show you which one I will prefer when it comes to themes. First of all, I will show you GitHub themes here. This is how it looks. This is the theme that is officially provided by GitHub. Here, GitHub dark, GitHub light, GitHub dimmed, GitHub colorblind. I like this one better because the colors in it... Sorry, I will choose GitHub dark because the colors here are highlighted differently. Another theme that is preferred is Jellyfish. Many people like Jellyfish themes. If I install it, then you will see VS Code in this way. Jellyfish will look like this. Another theme is material. It is very popular. If I use material theme here, then we have to install material theme. If you have installed material theme icons, then you can change the icons to control which extension you want. We have installed many extensions here. I will also tell you how to delete the extensions. Here, I am showing you VS Code and you can use VS Code icons. If I want to delete the material themes icon, then I will simply remove it. All the extensions that I have are visible here. If I want to use this icon, then I will select it. If I want, I can uninstall it. Sometimes, when we do anything uninstalling, we need to click on reload required. When I click on reload required, then my VS Code will be reloaded. You can customize your VS Code as per your needs. I will select my VS Code icons. I will select VS Code icons so that my icons look like this. I like this. I also like Jellyfish theme. There is another extension called Prettier. I won't install it. I just want to tell you that there is another extension called ES7. When we react, you will know. We will react in this course. Sorry for the spoilers. We are going to react in this course. React Redux, React Native Snippets. This is the extension that gives you React Snippets. We will use it when we react. We won't install it for now. But the most important extension that we have is called Live Preview. We will install this Live Preview extension because it is a very useful extension. All the extensions that I have told you about mostly help you in changing the look and feel of VS Code. But the extension that I am telling you about Live Preview, you will actually use it. Let's come to our HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. So, here are our HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. This is the HTML file. This is some code that tells the website how to look like. So, here I am saying that document should be in the title. I will write here, Harry's first website. Harry's first website. Harry's first website. Harry's first website will be a lie. You can write your name in it. Your name is key first website. And if I write here, Hey, this is my first website. And everyone write congratulations in the comment. Everyone who has this website, write congratulations. Congratulations for my first website. And congratulate each other. Make the atmosphere in the comment section. I will also come in the comment section. And I will give my heart to you all. Now, let's see how to do this. The biggest question that people have is there are two ways to see this. First, install Live Preview. Live Preview used to be very popular. But Microsoft has released this Live Preview. So, I will recommend this latest extension. This is also popular. But I am not going to run Live Preview. I am going to use Live Preview. After installing Live Preview, you see this icon. You will click on this. Your website will look like this. Now, you will say that I want to see this website in the browser. Because my website will be in the browser. So, if you want to see this in the browser, click on this. Open in browser. And let me tell you something interesting. You can close this and write that Harry's course is good. Let's say you wrote it. I am praising my own course. But yes, Harry's course is good. I wrote it here. And you noticed one thing here. I didn't reload this website. But even after that, it updated this content. Which I wrote in this VS Code. Which means whatever I write here, without reloading, it will be updated here. Will it be updated or not? Clap your hands. Clap your hands for us. And here, this is my first website. Harry's course is good. Let me write here. Sigma Harry's course is good. Sigma Harry's course is good. Sigma Harry's course is good. So, here you noticed how this extension will help us. Even if you reload it, it won't matter. Because it is being reloaded live. So, there are two things. Sometimes we want our page to be previewed here. Let me close this. So that you can see the code. Sometimes we want our code to be previewed here. Because we want to see its live preview. So, let's say I am writing anything. Harry's course is good. And this is sigma's course. I can write everything here. So, I can write here and watch here. And I can also make it smaller. So, I can see the live update here. If you have seen my old videos, I have used this extension of Live Server. Either this extension was not a disaster or I didn't know. Whatever it is, it is. Now, if something new comes, it takes time to know. But this is something that you should use. Because I use AC in my daily life. I do web development. I do it. I make websites. I don't just make videos. I also work on websites. And yes, I earn a lot of money by making websites. Now, you will get all this code on GitHub. So, you can go to the video description of any video. You will get the code of that corresponding video. You don't have to take that transition. Now, I will close this. Because my preview is visible here. Now, consider HTML, CSS, JavaScript and we talked about so many things in the last video. Now, I will tell you how to link all these three. Now, you will say, yes, you have made index.html. It is very good. You can see the title here. Harry's course's first website. Suppose, I call it as sigma web development course. So, it will change. sigma web development course Here, sigma web development course is written. And you can see here that it is updated. Now, I want my background to be red. So, I can write body and background color red. This is the syntax of CSS. I will teach you CSS in such a way that you won't be able to forget it. Don't worry. This CSS makes the color of the body red. And here, you can see that the color of the body will be red or not. Tell me in the comment section. Now, I will tell beginners that it won't be red. Beginners will think that it will be red. But it won't be. This HTML file is running. It doesn't know about this CSS file. Now, what is going on in my house? What does my neighbor know? Suppose, I have made dal here. And I expect my neighbor to make rice. And suppose, I expect that I eat it together. It doesn't happen. You can eat it sometimes. But you have to link it. You have to go and tell your neighbor that we will eat together. Now, here, there will be a handshake. How will it be a handshake? In HTML, you will tell where your CSS file is. So, there is a link tag. And you will also know the reason for not using the notepad. As soon as I write the link, here, link colon CSS. As soon as I select it, it did half of my work. I have to type this in the notepad manually. This is the syntax of HTML. I have to write it. But here, automatically, it will come. Here, it's name is style.css file. And here, it's style.css. If it's name was harry.css, I would have written harry.css. And guess what? Now, my background is red. Now, if I want my text to be white, I can write color white. Now, nothing will work. I have written color white. Now, it's white. The valid CSS syntax will work. And we will talk about it later in this course. So, this is what we have done. If I write alert here, and I write welcome to sigma web development course Suppose, I write welcome to sigma web development course here. What will happen? Will alert come here? Why not? I will tell you that this syntax is absolutely correct. There is no problem in syntax. And I will also read JavaScript very well. So, don't worry about this. This is JavaScript code which will flash on the screen welcome to sigma web development course. Why didn't it flash? Is my computer broken? No, my computer is absolutely correct. I want to tell you that I have to include the script. And let's include the script just before the body. Now, as soon as I include the script here, I will write script.js in src. How did I write this? First of all, I wrote script. First of all, I wrote script. Emmet abbreviation. What is Emmet? Emmet is a plugin which is built in VS code. You can select it and it will automatically complete. Now, I am writing script here and I am selecting the src. So, this means that I want to give a source file. You can also type it manually if you want. But the suggestions that are getting here make your code writing more powerful. They make you a great developer and increase your powers so that you don't get into trouble. And as soon as possible, your developer can be self-sufficient. src is equal to script.js You can see here that I have included it. Now, I will come here. So, here it is. Welcome to sigma web development course. Everyone, write in the comments that I have become self-sufficient. Write it because I know that you have become self-sufficient by looking at this box. JavaScript also worked. CSS also worked. JavaScript also worked. Now, you have become self-sufficient. I will reload it and it will come again. I will say OK and it will be closed. So, as soon as I visit this website, I will get to see an alert here. This is called alert in JavaScript. I will tell you what JavaScript is. I am not telling you to alert. I don't want to start it weirdly. I will finish html then CSS and then JavaScript. So, don't worry. And along with this, keep in mind the best practices that I am telling you. Because what I am telling you is coming from my experience. It is coming from a long time experience. As I said, you can use the live server. Nothing wrong in that. Use the live preview from Microsoft. Awesome. Now, I want you all to write sigma batch op in the comments. If you are enjoying the course, then write sigma batch op in the comments. You will enjoy it. If it is a free course, then it is a batch. So, write sigma batch op in the comments. Many people commented in the previous video on how to do this mouse wheel. So, you have to go to settings. Here you have to write mouse wheel. And here you have to check editor mouse wheel zoom. Then you have to press control and then use mouse wheel. I have pressed control here. I will be able to zoom in as soon as I do mouse wheel. If I right click and press command palette, then I can toggle screencast mode. Then you will be able to see what I am writing here. I have not toggled screencast mode in this video because you already know what I am typing. So, I can toggle screencast mode like this. I can turn it on so that you can see all the things that I am doing. In the previous video, we talked about how websites work. And you all understood this very well. Now, I will take the example of iPhone 15 Pro Max. I will order it and show you how client-server interaction will be when a user orders an iPhone. So, you will find it interesting. I will show you here. So, guys, here how websites work I have come to explain it on apple.com Now, see apple.com is a website. Data must have come from their server to here. I will click on pre-order of these HTML files. And after this, I simply click on the file. It has not come yet. It will come by September. I will select the file. I will select any color. I will select 250 GB, no trade-in, no apple coverage. After this, you will see how their communication is going on with their servers. So, in total, this is HTML, CSS, JavaScript. You can see here I have sourced the view page. So, this is how it looks. Now, I will check out here. I will continue as a guest. I will show you an interesting thing. As soon as I click on inspect, I will click on network. You can see that two-and-four communication is going on with apple servers. Which means that as I am doing the action here, JavaScript is communicating to the server and there appropriate action is taking and sending me the data. I will say I would like to be delivered continued shipping address. This October, I will deliver the shipping. I will tell you the update when it comes. I will keep you updated. Yes, everything is fine. I agree. I agree. Please like the video because I also order iPhones to explain web development. This is the OTP that we have. I will confirm OTP and my purchase is done. In total, I requested something from apple.com server. Please give me an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple.com said, please buy it. So, this kind of communication between the server and client is done through JavaScript. without loading the page. As you can see, I have selected iPhone and clicked on different things. So, all these things are done through JavaScript. The styling is done through CSS. And the written text is HTML. I hope that you will remember this example. And I will definitely show you the full video. Otherwise, many people will say that it is a fake. I will show you the same phone when it comes. So, I will unbox it in front of you. So, this is how your websites work. I hope you understood this example. Please tell me in the comment section if I want to give away this iPhone. What will be the best thing? I mean, you also know that I have given it genuinely and I will also give it away. Please tell me in the comment section. I don't know about this. So, you should know about this. You will get notes and cheat sheets there. If you go to codevidari.com you will get to see notes. And you can download notes here. Along with that, you will get to see cheat sheets below. For example, if I want to access HTML cheat sheet, I can access it here. Here, all the elements are there. But, I will tell you about all the elements in this course. Along with that, if you want to download my notes HTML handwritten, you can download it. I have written it handwritten. You will enjoy reading it. I will tell you everything in this course. But, you will enjoy more if you download these notes. I will make your learning experience so good that you will also enjoy it. Now, I want you all to do one thing. Put the initial review of this course in this first video. I want you all to go to this video and post the initial review in the comment section. I want you to write the link of the first video about your experience in this course. And, give me stars out of 5. Give me the star rating. I know that the course is not that good but, I want you to comment on the quality of the course in the first video. If you do this, I will be happy. Go to the first video and read this course. Now, we will talk about how you can earn money after doing this course. The first way to earn money from web development is to create websites. There are many websites that you can create and you will get good money from them. Many people integrate APIs and earn good money from them. Many people say that chat gbt is here and nothing will happen. But, this is not true. Creating a website for you makes it easier. And, when you use chat gbt you become a giga chat developer. So, use chat gbt as much as possible. And, you can save your time. In fact, I can deliver more to my freelancing clients since the time I started using chat gbt. I can do more than half of the work with chat gbt. And, I can do the work that chat gbt can't do. I can finally package it. And, I don't have to answer whether I used chat gbt or not. You can easily deliver everything. So, use chat gbt. Chat gbt can't do everything. You have to use chat gbt and then create a website to deliver to your freelancing clients. From where you can get freelancing clients? You can go to a website like Fiverr. I know it's difficult to get work on Fiverr. But, you can go to buyer request. There's a buyer request option in Fiverr. You can search it. If I show you the images, you can get a buyer request. You can pitch your work to them and then I'll have to do this work. You'll get work from here. As you get good reviews on your gig, you'll earn more money. For example, if you have a gig of Fiverr and no one has ever ordered it, then you'll never get work easily. But, if you have a gig and 5-6 people have ordered it and everyone has given you 5 stars, then things become easier for you. Because, buyers want the ones they're getting work from to have a good credibility. And they're paying for it. So, they want their money to be not wasted. So, there are many freelancing websites like Fiverr, Upwork, which you can try. But, before trying, you should make good websites. And today, responsive, cutting-edge technologies, like you want to integrate the ChartGPT API, you'll get such work. No one will ask you to make a design or make a simple navbar. I'm saying that most of the clients don't do this. You can make complex websites and earn good money. Then, get a job as a web developer. If you get a job as a web developer, which if you become a good web developer, you'll get a job. And it's not like that, jobs have decreased. In fact, the demand of senior developers is increasing. And their back-age is also increasing. People are earning more in coding than before. If you're a very basic developer, then yes, ChartGPT will replace you. After this, you can sell your services by making an Instagram account. If you upload any kind of images in your Instagram account, and you take a little traction where you talk about websites, you start approaching clients. Many clients approach me and tell me that they want to make a website. I'm not saying that you should have a lot of followers. You can start with very few followers. After this, you can help people one-to-one. You can get this from clients' Instagram or social media. You can say at the end of your reel that if you want to learn anything, I'll tell you in DM. And you can easily get clients here. Trust me if it helps you. After this, you can sell codes. I was going to sell this code. I've uploaded this for free. But this code was going to be paid to you. That's the truth. And whenever you get this code, everyone would definitely pay for it. Now it's not necessary that you have to make a web development code. There are many things in web development. Like how to use ChartGPT API, make a chart GPT code, if you get a website, it will be easy to sell codes. The course economy is huge. Many people contacted me to buy this course. That I should launch this course as a paid course on their platform. But I didn't do it because I wanted to give it free. I decided to do it. I even posted it. People contacted me till the last moment that don't put the course for free. But I did. So you have to write sigma batch OP in the comment section. So, by uploading this course for free, many course sellers got hurt. Because when you get iPhone 15, 16, 19 Pro Max for free, who will ask Blackberry? That too paid Blackberry. And I'm saying this because I've put a lot of effort and experience in this. Only I know that. You'll also know that in the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. You'll get a lot of things in the upcoming videos. I'm aware of the fact that we're taking a slow start. But remember, we'll raise the bar like anything. So, do access the playlist. Like the video. Give your village a name. Thank you."
