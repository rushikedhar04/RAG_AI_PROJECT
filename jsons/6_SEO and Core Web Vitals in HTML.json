  "text": " In this video, we will learn about Core Web Vitals and why Core Web Vitals are important Like this video and keep the high energy on the line The thing is that your website should be available in all devices like iPad, iPhone, Android, Surface Pro 4 Because we have to give a good experience to all the users through our website In this video, we will also learn that Chrome has a hidden tool called Lighthouse And how you can use it to enhance your website So write in the comment section Sigma Batch OP Let's go to the computer screen So guys I have come to my computer screen And now I will make a new folder called Video 6 And here in video 6, I will open VS Code as always And today I will tell you about SEO First of all, I want to tell you about SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization If you look at any website, it has SEO Let's take the example of Amazon.in I opened Amazon.in, so Amazon.in wants this website to load as soon as possible So that their products can be available in the search Google is a search engine, and Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users So Google wants to show the pages that are fast, present information well And along with that, there are some things that the user has the best experience For example, let us say there are two pages One page has told us about dog food The other page has also told us about dog food But page 2 loads very fast, so Google will give it more preference Along with that, there are core web vitals Which Google considers to rank two pages First of all, content is important If your content is good, then your website can rank without the core web vitals But if you are competing with a page that has presented similar quality content Then your core web vitals will be seen And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference So the first thing that comes to your core web vitals is your CLS You see this video here, which I have run from web.dev website You see that someone comes to your website and he is trying to cancel the order And by mistake he cancelled the order, and this thing above is visible And he shifted the layout and the order is complete But the user wanted to click on no when the order is not complete In this case, the user experience is very bad And as you have seen in this video, this should not happen So our CLS should be less Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means how much the page is shifting while loading Suppose you have loaded the page and you get to see this This was above and when this part was loaded, then it shifted The layout should not shift if you put width and height in the images The next metric that we are going to talk about is LCP And LCP stands for Largest Contextual Paint This means that if the user is viewing a page, then the biggest element is loaded For example, the biggest part in this is this image How long is it loading? The whole page will be loaded, but the biggest element which is the most important How long is it loading? Web.dev and Google should have a good LCP score of 2.5 seconds That means the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds After this comes the third metric which is FID Which stands for First Input Delay First Input Delay means that if a user has clicked on any input element Like a button or any input on a page Then how long does the input process take? For example, if you have clicked on a button, then how long does the button click browser process? Google and Web.dev should have a 100 ms less input process So these were the 3 core web vitals which are very important For your information, I will tell you that these core web vitals are updated But these 3 are very important and you should know about them Now I will show you what is Lighthouse report and what is Qn And how will these 3 core web vitals be evaluated So I will tell you here If you will inspect it by right-clicking And it may be your right side, so you can click here and bring it down Or you can bring it here again and bring it down by clicking here I prefer to bring it down because I am used to see it from the beginning Now you can see the Lighthouse option here Lighthouse generates a report and tells you what can be improved in your HTML page For example, if I want to see how my website looks on mobile So I will click on mobile or desktop and close this tab I will click on mobile and then on analyze page load So this will generate a report for me You can see here that a report has been generated Performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO and PWA All these things are being shown Now you can see here that some things are shown in red Means the scope of improvement is in the page Now you can see here that it tells you to size your images properly Your website can be loaded in 2.7 seconds So all these suggestions are given to you by Lighthouse If you incorporate these suggestions, your website will load well and give you a good experience Now you can see here that it says that image elements do not have explicit width and height So you should give width and height to the image The width and height attribute that we have read in the previous video You should use it so that your browser can reserve space When we set width and height in HTML, space gets reserved in the browser Otherwise, if we don't set the height and width Then the browser won't know how much space to reserve And the time when CSS will load, the whole page will shift So we don't want our page to shift during loading time If our page starts shifting, then suppose we are going to click here Then by mistake when it shifts, we might be clicking here Suppose an image was going to come here I am going to click here And the time I clicked, this image loaded and all the content shifted And instead of clicking here by mistake, I will click on the image This is called cumulative layout shift So this kind of shift is not preferred by Google And it should be minimized You can see that the space has very less cumulative layout shift So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift in minimum So that our user can get a very good experience So here we get many more suggestions And this is for our mobile Now we can generate desktop report And it will be generated So as you can see that it has generated a report In performance 92 marks In accessibility 100 out of 82 marks In best practices 75 out of 75 Now you can see that the good things have been told here And the scope of improvement that Lighthouse tells you So this is a hidden tool that we all should use Now I want to tell you about Meta text and Meta description So what I will do here is that I will create a new file And I will name it index.html And after creating an HTML file The first SEO element that I want to tell you is title If your title is reflecting the content of your page Then this is a very good SEO practice Whenever your page is changing, you should make the title So that it reflects the content of your page Because if you want your website on Google Then it will come according to the title So let's say you write here Google index is code with harry And you write like this So this is the title of the page And this is the title of the page that YouTube has put This is the title of the page that Instagram has put This is the title of the page that GitHub has put So if the title is put on the page And the title actually reflects the content of the page Then your website will rank very well Now let's say I put the content And I put an h1 And I write harry And after that I write a paragraph And I write lorem45 Now why did I write lorem45 Let me do a view word wrap Why did I write 45 I wrote 45 because I am lazy And 4 and 5 are around So I wrote 4 and 5 I also write 23 because they are around So there is no other reason Now I will preview it Now this document is written If I leave it like this, it won't be a good SEO practice Let's say I write about harry And I write code with harry Which is my website And by doing this, my title will reflect here As you can see So by doing this My website will have more chances to be seen in Google By inspecting it I will also take out its light house report And see what are the scope of improvements Now its light house report will be very good Because there is nothing that I should improve But when I will put images, I will get suggestions Like put width Put height Along with that, I will tell you another trick By which you can see your website in any mobile You will know this So you click here You can see the computer here And if you select responsive Then you can see How your website will be seen in any kind of device So you can see whether your website is responsive or not By doing this If you go to a specific device In 12 Pro, your website will be seen in the resolution of iPhone 12 Pro It will look like this Now don't say why it's not 15 or 16 12 Pro means Bigger iPhone device In such a big device How your website will be seen This is simply being told to you So now you can see How it will be seen in Surface Pro 7 By clicking here How it will be seen in Google phones You can also know this And if you want to take a general view Of how your website will be seen in responsive device In any kind of device Suppose in iPad If you don't have a device Then you can select responsive and select the approximate width of your device In all the widths Your website should be seen well I will tell you how this happens in this course Now if you click here again The responsive view will be closed And when it is closed, your website will look like this I will close it I will come back here and tell you about Meta Text Here I will write If I write here, then Meta DESC is coming I will click on Meta DESC And I can give the description of my page here Suppose I give This is the page This is the page which contains Description About Harry Ok And here you can write whatever page content you want Whatever you want Suppose you write What is SEO What is SEO This page has put this Meta description SEO stands for this Now it is not necessary that a search engine Will parse your Meta DESC If it likes it, then it will parse it And keep your Meta DESC here If you have not put Meta DESC Then your content can be generated from Meta DESC So this is the responsibility of the search engine We don't know what Bing and Google will do But from our side, our page should be to the point Especially if we are writing a blog And we want our page to rank organically So here you can see I have put Meta DESC The keyword used to be very good But now the Meta keyword Has been deprecated Meta keyword is not used at all The code of Meta keyword looks like this But it is assumed that Meta keywords do not rank in SEO Because people abuse it Suppose you have written a page about pets And you have written What is SEO in Meta keyword So it is not that your page will rank I will fix the double quotes here So if I put Meta keyword here Then it is not necessary that a search engine will constrict it Search engines do not accept Meta keywords They say that we don't want to see your Meta keywords So don't put them So Meta keywords used to be very good But now it is not good Now AI is coming So your content will be understood What is your content value Now if you want to know about these core web vitals For example If I inspect it right click And go to Lighthouse And get a Lighthouse report for desktop Then some core web vitals come After that FCP comes First Contextual Paint Now you can see everything is 100% There was nothing much in this content But you can see here What is it doing Pages with websocket cannot enter back forward There is websocket in this Because we are using this extension Live preview Otherwise accessibility is also 100% It is a very good page PWA is Progressive Web Apps Which we will not make now Total Blocking Time, Cumulative Layout Shift Speed Index If you want to know about these First Contextual Paint Which is going to be seen by the user How long it has been painted on the browser So if you want to see this You have to go to web.dev Web.dev is a very good website And you can see here They talk about this You can learn about these things If you want to learn PWA You can learn PWA There is a lot of good content But in this course We will focus on making HTML, CSS, JavaScript and websites This thing should have come to you Because of which I told you about this If you have not yet accessed Sigma Web Development Series Then do access it Access the playlist and bookmark Click on star and save That's it for now Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you next time Thank you"
